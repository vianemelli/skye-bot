# Repository Guidelines

This document summarizes how we work in this repository. It is intended for contributors and automation agents alike.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `src/`: TypeScript source for the bot. Entry point is `src/index.ts`.
- `src/utils/`: Small, focused helpers (e.g., markdown utilities).
- `assets/`: Static images used in the README and UI assets.
- `data/`: Runtime data storage (chat logs, memory, etc.).
- `env.example`: Example environment configuration.
- `dist/`: Compiled output from `tsc` (generated by `bun run build`).
- `Dockerfile`: Container build setup.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `bun install`: Install dependencies.
- `bun run dev`: Run the bot in watch mode using Bun.
- `bun run start`: Run the bot once using Bun.
- `bun run build`: Compile TypeScript to `dist/`.
- `bun run typecheck`: Run TypeScript type checks without emitting output.
- `bun run lint`: Run ESLint.
- `bun run format`: Format files with Prettier.

Compiled output is produced by `bun run build`, but local development runs TypeScript directly via Bun.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- Language: TypeScript (ESM). `tsconfig.json` enables `strict` mode.
- Indentation: follow existing files (2 spaces).
- File naming: lower camelCase for modules (for example, `contextBuilder.ts`).
- Keep functions small and focused; prefer clear names over comments.

Formatting: Prettier is configured. Linting: ESLint with TypeScript support.

## Testing Guidelines

No automated test framework is currently set up. If you add tests, put them in a dedicated `tests/` or `src/**/__tests__/` directory and document how to run them in `package.json` scripts.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Recent commit history uses short, imperative messages (for example, “Add long-term memory”, “Fix image processing issue”). Please follow that style.

For pull requests:

- Include a concise summary and a short testing note (for example, “Tested: bun run dev”).
- Link related issues when applicable.
- Include screenshots only if UI output changes.

## Configuration & Secrets

Create a `.env` file based on `env.example` and set `BOT_TOKEN`, `OPENAI_KEY`, and model configuration values. Never commit real secrets.
